### FAQ

> To access the Requests panel, press **F8** in the song list screen. If you have the chart requested, pressing the check mark will close the panel and lead you directly to the chart (if it's within search parameters). If you do not have the chart requested, you can choose to download the chart in-game or open the website link to download it directly (if it can't be downloaded in-game). If the chart does not show up, please double-check your filters and search (if you're using SongOrganizer). If it still isn't showing up, you can force-refresh the song list by doing `Ctrl + R`.

> Some people asked to display the song name when requesting but this is very dangerous. If someone maliciously uploaded a chart with unwanted words in it, using the names in chat could result in a permanent Twitch ban. For this reason, only the song IDs and leaderboard links will be sent in chat.
